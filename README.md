A simple cli tool to visualise the state of a Python project's _type completeness_, from the output of pyright's [`--outputjson --verifytypes` command](https://microsoft.github.io/pyright/#/typed-libraries?id=verifying-type-completeness):

![Sample graph output for prefect](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mjpieters/pyright-analysis/refs/heads/main/assets/graph-screenshot.png)  <!-- refresh with `task dev:readme:refresh-graph` -->

The interactive graph depicts a projects modules as a tree, with each the size of each module based on the number of exported symbols.

## Usage

Use a Python tool manager like [`uv tool`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/) or [`pipx`](https://pipx.pypa.io/):

```sh
$ uv tool install pyright
$ uv tool install pyright-analysis
```

Then generate a type completeness JSON report for your package, and transform the report into a graph:

```sh
$ pyright --outputjson --ignoreexternal --verifytypes PACKAGE > PACKAGE.json
$ pyright-analysis PACKAGE.json
```

This will open the resulting graph in your browser.

Full help documentation is available on the command-line:

## Features

- Interactive responsive graph. Hover over each package to get more detail about symbol counts and completeness, or click on packages to zoom in.
- Export options:
    - Full stand-alone HTML page.
    - HTML div snippet with configurable HTML id.
    - Static image export as PNG, JPG, WebP, SVG or PDF.
    - Plotly JSON graph representation.

## GitHub Action

You can generate visualiations for your own projects in your GitHub workflow by using the [`pyright-analysis-action` action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/pyright-analysis-action).

## Development

This project uses [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to handle Python dependencies and environments; use `uv sync` to get an up-to-date virtualenv with all dependencies. This includes development dependencies such as [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) (used for linting and formatting) and [Pyright](https://microsoft.github.io/pyright/) (used to validate type annotations).

### Linting and formatting

While PRs and commits on GitHub are checked for linting and formatting issues, it's easier to check for issues locally first. After running `uv sync`, run `uv run pre-commit install` to install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks that will run these tools and format your changes automatically on commits. These hooks also run `uv sync` whenever you working tree changes.

### Testing

This project uses `pytest` to run its tests: `uv run pytest`.
